## Customer Retention Heatmap for E-Comme
This repository hosts a Python script designed to generate a Customer Retention Heatmap for an E-commerce company, illustrating the retention rates over time. This script provided in this repository allows for a visual understanding of customer loyalty and retention

## Data
The dataset for this analysis is obtained from Kaggle. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishikumarrajvansh/marketing-insights-for-e-commerce-company.

## Project Purpo
Retention Analysis: Use
Insightful Visualizations: Crea
Data Analysis Skill Showcase: Demonstrate the application of data visualization techniques in Python for real-world E-commerce data.
Code Description
The Heat map.py script processes customer transaction data to produce heatmaps that represent customer retention rates. Here's what the script does:

## Data Loading and Preprocessing:

1. Import transaction data from the specified dataset.
Prepare data by extracting necessary attributes like purchase dates and customer IDs.
Cohort Analysis:

2. Define cohorts based on the customers' first purchase date.
Track subsequent transactions of the customers within these cohorts over time.
Heatmap Generation:

3. Calculate retention rates for each cohort.
Generate a heatmap using Python's seaborn and matplotlib libraries to visually display these retention rates over time.

## Features
Cohort Identification: Segment customers into cohorts based on their first purchase.
Retention Calculation: Calculate the retention rate for each cohort across various time intervals.
Visual Representation: Produce a heatmap to provide a clear and impactful visual representation of customer retention.

## Usage
The script is applicable to any transactional dataset with similar formats, providing a visualization of how customer retention evolves over time. It is especially useful for marketing analysts and business strategists interested in customer lifecycle management.

## File Structure
Heat map.py: The primary Python script that calculates retention rates and generates the heatmap.
